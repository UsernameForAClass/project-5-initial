# Project:  Sorting Things Out

This project is all about implementing a sorting algorithm utility class. You're going
to start with a SortingUtility class that has been pre-populated with method headers 
(so you know what your input and output are supposed to be), as well as a driver class you can utilize to 
test your algorithm (it's similar to the one we used in our previous sorting activity).
